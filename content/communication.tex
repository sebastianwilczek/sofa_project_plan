In this project four meetings were identified. First of all we have the daily scrum meeting where the project team discusses what they have worked on during the most recent project day, what they will do on the current day and if there are any obstacles that stops them from doing their work.
\newline
Then we have the customer meeting in which the project team discuss the progress and obstacles with the customer. The coach meeting informs the coach about the progress and obstacles. Finally in the sprint planning the project team plans the next sprint and decides which issues will be solved in the next sprint, also the past sprint will be discussed and analyzed.
