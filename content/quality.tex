\subsection{Plan Quality Management}
To ensure a sufficient quality level, every member of the team is involved in the quality process sharing responsibilities. The product owner is involved by providing the test framework.

\subsection{Perform Quality Assurance}
How the quality test will be performed depends on the type of the module being tested.\\
Design fragments and frontend modules are reviewed and, in case of front end modules, manually tested. They are then presented and discussed by the whole team and the product owner at the weekly meetings.\\
Backend modules are also reviewed by one team member, but the review includes writing firebase unit tests for it.\\

\subsection{Control Quality}

To ensure complete quality testing on the software every completed part will be assigned to a quality testing state. A team member that has not been part of the creation of the relevant piece then performs the quality testing.
