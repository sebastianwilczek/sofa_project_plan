\lhead{\thesection \space Cost Management}

This chapter deals with the cost management of the project in question. It is being detailed how cost are managed in the project and how costs and expenses are to be monitored over the course of the project.
\newline
Costs do not play a vital role in the planning of the project. Given that the project is part of a University module, the project team is working without compensation and all resources, such as they are mentioned in \textit{Chapter \ref{sec:procurement}}, are being provided by the client.
\newline
Cost management might still become a part of the project in the event that the project requires further resources. In this case, the responsibility for providing these resources are that of the client. However, the project team would then be responsible for defining why the new resource is necessary for development and on what scale the resource needs to be provided. However, this case is highly unlikely and is for now only mentioned for the purpose of completeness.
